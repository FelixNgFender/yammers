cost of planning activities
no device 30 minutes before bed
find your balance
hack: jump right into the next activity even if it's just for 3 minutes, don't let the momentum die, just like hiking, you'll do more without feeling tired
don't be afraid to end an activity early if you're not feeling it
motivation: remember why you started. for me, it was during the seattle summer, i met people, inspired by their stories, and wanted to be like them. i wanted to be a better person. i wanted to be a better friend. i wanted to be a better partner. i wanted to be a better son. i wanted to be a better brother. i wanted to be a better human being. i wanted to be a better me.
